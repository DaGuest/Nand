#  Nand to Tetris implementations

This is my implementation of project 6 and 7 in the course Nand to Tetris part 1.

## Objective project 6
The object was to build an assembly program that can translate Hack assembly code into machine code.
The implementation was made using Java.

## Running the assembler
To run the assembler:
1. Compile the java code using: `javac Assembler.java`
2. Run the Assembler with: `java Assembler xxx.asm`
3. The output is written into the _output.hack_ file.

## Objective project 7
The object was to build the first implementation of the VMTranslator that is able to translate VM code into assembly code.
The implementation was made using C++.
